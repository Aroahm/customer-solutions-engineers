# Get to know our API

The Stuart API is open and free to use, it allows developers to integrate our delivery service into their own ordering process. To develop their services Stuart provide a sandbox environment where developers can play with the API. Orders created in this testing environment are handled by bots, everything is simulated so you can play with it too!

---
Please find below a list of questions, try to get through as many questions as you can. There is no specific time limit for completing this test and if you cannot complete a question, simply explain what is preventing you from doing so. The goal is to let you discover our API while playing around with it.

Come back to us with your answers as soon as you feel ready to move on!

Follow the [Getting started page of the Stuart API documentation](https://stuart.api-docs.io/v2/general-topics/getting-started) to create your own account in the Sandbox environment. Provide us with the email address used to create the account. 
1. Play around creating jobs via API and trying out some of the endpoints we offer. (You needn’t provide us an ‘answer’ for this stage)
2. In what way/s can you identify a job that you have created?
3. How can you find out what is happening with the job (as the client or as the recipient)? 
4. For a given job, what was the first estimation of the time that the driver would arrive to the dropoff destination?
5. How long was the job searching for a driver?
6. When did the driver eventually deliver the package?
7. Create a new job which should be delivered to your customer at 6:30PM (either today or tomorrow depending when you are doing this test). 
8. At what time should the driver pick up the package?
9. How would you identify when the driver eventually picks up the package?
